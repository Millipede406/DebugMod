# DebugMod

A collection of cheats and tools to help modders test their mods. But it's also kinda fun to mess around with.
## Features:
 - Invulnerability
 - Improved Screenshot Mode
     - Hide Player
     - Hide Shots
     - Hide Cursor
 - Disable Fog
 - Infinite Stamina
 - Infinite Damage
 - Fast Travel
 - Shiny Mode

All of these features can be enabled and disabled through the debug menu, which appears on screen.
The debug menu can also be enabled and disabled, via the F6 key.
